# Beer & Coffee Maps - Cloud Computing Assignment 2

This was the result of the second Assignment we had to complete for our Cloud Computing Course. 
The concept behind this project was to create a maps/review style website that would iron out some of the issues that
I have found in other similar sites. For instance, Google Maps, while still the gold standard, makes it very difficult to
view all of the places that you have visited. Further, I have always found the reviews in Google maps to be quite lacking,
namely because most of then end up being 5 star reviews.
Other sites, while using maps, are not map based, which doesn't give the best overview.

This project implements the following aspects of Google Cloud:
App Engine with traffic splitter
Google Maps API
Cloud SQL
Cloud Storage
Cloud Data Store
Big Query with lambda functions
Google Translate, though there are issue with deprication of Python 2
Email

This project was writting using a Python 2 backend, and a Javascript/HTML front end using Django.

Further details are included in the assignment report, which has been added to the repository.

1) connect the login to the MongoDB on google cloud
	- Only password is hashed
	- creates an object for the user
	- stores the object in the session storage
	- all user related details go through this object
	- if the session storage is empty an generic object is created to hold guest details

2) Build objects for the locations
	- objects hold templates for the view_location and review
	- review location only accessible from the view_location menu
	- object types are determined by the location types
	- A factory pattern is thus required for creating the objects

3) Database
	- change the primary key to an autogenerated number
	- Go through each of the locations and determine the following:
		- are they still operating
		- correct the longitute and latitude
	- Add a suburb field for the correct suburb
	- The current suburb becomes region/council
	- State and Country names to be full names
	- Descriptions either entered or done through wikipedia API
	- Split the local type for some more generic types for the site, and specific ones for the icons
